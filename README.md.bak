# MEAN App

This is a basic mean app project set up with Angular CLI, including standard configurations for building and serving the app.

## Project Structure

- `src/` — source code including components, styles, assets, and main entry files.
- `angular.json` — Angular CLI workspace configuration file.
- `package.json` — project dependencies and scripts.
- `tsconfig.app.json` — TypeScript configuration for the app.
- `tsconfig.spec.json` — TypeScript configuration for tests.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended v16+)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- Angular CLI installed globally (optional, but recommended):

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
Setup
Clone or download the repository.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Development Server
Run the app locally with hot reload:

bash
Copy code
ng serve
By default, the app will be served at http://localhost:4200/.

Build
To build the project for production:

bash
Copy code
ng build --configuration production
The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/frontend directory.

Testing
To run unit tests using Karma:

bash
Copy code
ng test
Project Details
The main entry point is src/main.ts.

Polyfills are loaded from src/polyfills.ts (includes zone.js).

The app uses src/index.html as the main HTML page.

Global styles are in src/styles.css.

Assets (images, icons, etc.) should be placed in src/assets/.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors related to Angular builders, make sure you have @angular-devkit/build-angular installed:

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular
Make sure your Angular CLI version matches your Angular dependencies to avoid compatibility issues.

If you want, I can help you customize it further or generate one for the backend (Node/Express) as well!

Gotcha! Here’s a combined README.md template covering both your Angular frontend and Node/Express backend (MEAN stack style):

# MEAN Stack CRUD Application

This project is a full-stack CRUD application built with the MEAN stack:
- **MongoDB** for database
- **Express.js** for backend API
- **Angular** for frontend UI
- **Node.js** as the runtime

Backend Details
Uses Express.js to create REST API endpoints.

MongoDB is accessed through Mongoose models.

Example routes: /api/books to perform CRUD operations on book resources.

Error handling and request validation included.

Frontend Details
Angular application with components for listing, creating, updating, and deleting books.
